While using Expo's `Camera` component, I encountered an issue where the camera preview would freeze intermittently, particularly under high load or when rapidly switching between different camera features (flash, zoom, etc.).  The app wouldn't crash, but the preview would become stuck on a single frame until manually restarting the app or navigating to a different screen.  The problem was inconsistent, making debugging difficult. I suspected a problem with memory management or resource contention within the Expo Camera module.
